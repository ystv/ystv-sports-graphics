# Sports Graphics Developer Docs

If you want to hack on the sports graphics application, or just curious about how it's put together, you've come to the right place!

These documents are meant to be read in a roughy chronological order, though you can skip back and forth if you like:

- [Getting Started](./00-getting-started.md) - setting up a local copy of the system to work on
- [Code Structure](./01-code-structure.md) - how things are laid out and where to look for what
- [Data Model](./02-data-model.md) - where we store data and how it's structured
- [Testing](./03-testing.md) - the various bits of automation that check your code for mistakes
- [Workflow](./04-workflow.md) - how to get the code from your laptop into the main codebase
- [Deployment](./05-deployment.md) - the process of that code getting into users' hands

## Assumed Knowledge

We will assume that you know at least the basics of JavaScript and React.js. If you don't, there's plenty of resources online that teach it far better than we ever could - for React specifically, the [beta documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/) provides a great introduction to the key concepts.
